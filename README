SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: DD-WRT (preferably latest), cURL

VERSION: 20180310
DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/m-parashar/adbhostgen/releases/tag/20180310

INSTALLATION:
-------------

1a. Download installer.sh and make it executable (chmod +x), then run it in /tmp or /jffs.
    It will automatically create /jffs/dnsmasq and extract required files into it. OR

1b. Download and extract adbhostgen.7z or adbhostgen.tar.gz into /jffs/dnsmasq directory.

2. OPTIONAL: Edit adbhostgen.sh to set BLITZ mode to 1, if you want an aggressive hosts file. By default BLITZ is set to 0.

3. Run adbhostgen.sh in /jffs/dnsmasq


SETTINGS:
---------

1. Disable internal flash (JFFS2) if you already have a USB drive mounted as /jffs.

2. Enable DNSMasq and local DNS for LAN and WAN. Add these lines under the additional options section.

	conf-file=/jffs/dnsmasq/mpdomains
	addn-hosts=/jffs/dnsmasq/mphosts

3. Enter additional options for dnsmasq if required, for example:

	domain-needed
	bogus-priv

4. Under Administration -> Cron, enter this or choose your own schedule:

	0 6 * * 1,4 root /jffs/dnsmasq/adbhostgen.sh

5. Reboot


USAGE:
------

Add your blacklist or whitelist domains to myblacklist and mywhitelist files respectively.
Do not save anything in blacklist or whitelist files as they will be overwritten every
time the script is executed.

CHANGELOG:
----------

20180310:
Introduced command line arguments for changing BLITZ mode on the fly and dynamically
adding domains to myblacklist/mywhitelist files.

USAGE: adbhostgen.sh [-h | -? | --help] [-v | --version] [-z | -0] [-Z | -1] [-b | --bl=<domain.name>] [-w | --wl=<domain.name>]

OPERATION:
        [-z | -0]                       Optimum protection, set BLITZ=0 [DEFAULT]
        [-Z | -1]                       Maximum protection, set BLITZ=1
        [-d | -D]                       Ignore personal lists, set DISTRIB=1
        [-b | --bl=]    domain.name     Add domain.name to myblacklist
        [-w | --wl=]    domain.name     Add domain.name to mywhitelist
        [-h | --help]                   Display this help screen and exit
        [-v | --version]                Print adbhostgen.sh version and exit

EXAMPLES:
        adbhostgen.sh -1 --bl=example1.com --wl=example2.com
        adbhostgen.sh -b example1.com -w example2.com --wl=example3.com
