DEVELOPED AND TESTED ON: NETGEAR R8500 / DD-WRT v3.0-r35030M kongac (02/19/18)

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: DD-WRT (preferably latest), cURL

VERSION: 20180312
DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/m-parashar/adbhostgen/releases/tag/20180312

INSTALLATION:
-------------

1a. Download installer.sh and make it executable (chmod +x), then run it in /tmp or /jffs.
    It will automatically create /jffs/dnsmasq and extract required files into it. OR

1b. Download and extract adbhostgen.7z or adbhostgen.tar.gz into /jffs/dnsmasq directory.

2. OPTIONAL: Edit adbhostgen.sh to set BLITZ mode to 1, if you want an aggressive hosts file. By default BLITZ is set to 0.

3. Run adbhostgen.sh in /jffs/dnsmasq


SETTINGS:
---------

1. Disable internal flash (JFFS2) if you already have a USB drive mounted as /jffs.

2. Enable DNSMasq and local DNS for LAN and WAN. Add these lines under the additional options section.

	conf-file=/jffs/dnsmasq/mpdomains
	addn-hosts=/jffs/dnsmasq/mphosts

3. Enter additional options for dnsmasq if required, for example:

	domain-needed
	bogus-priv

4. Under Administration -> Cron, enter this or choose your own schedule:

	0 6 * * 1,4 root /jffs/dnsmasq/adbhostgen.sh

5. Reboot


USAGE:
------

Add your blacklist or whitelist domains to myblacklist and mywhitelist files respectively.
Do not save anything in blacklist or whitelist files as they will be overwritten every
time the script is executed.

CHANGELOG:
----------

20180312:
A. New command line options to pause and resume protection.
B. Added more ad/malicious domains in both hosts and dnsmasq format.
   Even BLITZ=0 mode now blocks approx 672984 unique ad/mal domains.
   BLITZ=1 is likely to result in ~40-50MB hosts file. Exercise caution.

USAGE:
        adbhostgen.sh [-h | -? | --help] [-v | --version] [-z | -1] [-Z | -3] [-b | --bl=<domain.name>] [-w | --wl=<domain.name>]

OPERATION:
        [-z | -1]                       Safe minimum protection, set BLITZ=1
        [-O | -2]                       [DEFAULT] optimum protection, set BLITZ=2
        [-Z | -3]                       Unlock maximum protection, set BLITZ=3
        [-d | -D]                       Ignore personal lists, set DISTRIB=1
        [-b | --bl=]    domain.name     Add domain.name to myblacklist
        [-w | --wl=]    domain.name     Add domain.name to mywhitelist
        [-p | --pause]                  Pause protection
        [-r | --resume]                 Resume protection
        [-h | --help]                   Display this help screen and exit
        [-v | --version]                Print adbhostgen.sh version and exit

EXAMPLES:
        adbhostgen.sh -1 --bl=example1.com --wl=example2.com
        adbhostgen.sh -b example1.com -w example2.com --wl=example3.com
