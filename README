DEVELOPED AND TESTED ON: NETGEAR R8500 / DD-WRT v3.0-r35030M kongac (02/19/18)

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: DD-WRT (preferably latest), cURL

DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/m-parashar/adbhostgen/releases/latest

INSTALLATION:
-------------

1a. Download installer.sh and make it executable (chmod +x), then run it in /tmp or /jffs.
    It will automatically create /jffs/dnsmasq and extract required files into it. OR

1b. Download and extract adbhostgen.7z or adbhostgen.tar.gz into /jffs/dnsmasq directory.

2. Run adbhostgen.sh in /jffs/dnsmasq


SETTINGS:
---------

1. Disable internal flash (JFFS2) if you already have a USB drive mounted as /jffs.
   SEE: https://i.imgur.com/bDJBxd8.png

2. Enable DNSMasq and local DNS for LAN and WAN. Add these lines under the additional options section.

	conf-file=/jffs/dnsmasq/mpdomains
	addn-hosts=/jffs/dnsmasq/mphosts

    SEE: https://i.imgur.com/ez7yLM4.png

3. Enter additional options for dnsmasq if required, for example:

	domain-needed
	bogus-priv

4. Under Administration -> Cron, enter this or choose your own schedule:

	0 6 * * 1,4 root /jffs/dnsmasq/adbhostgen.sh

5. Reboot


USAGE:
------

Add your blacklist or whitelist domains to myblacklist and mywhitelist files respectively.
Do not save anything in blacklist or whitelist files as they will be overwritten every
time the script is executed.

CHANGELOG:
----------

20180312rev2:
A. added --offline mode, for processing existing lists without re-downloading everything.
B. BLITZ=0 mode is back. Four levels of protection exist now: 0, 1, 2 [default], and 3.
   You can override default aggression level with command line arguments.
C. Added more lists and distributed everything among the four BLITZ levels.

USAGE:
        adbhostgen.sh [-? | -h | --help] [-v | --version] [-1] [-2] [-b | --bl=<domain.name>] [-w | --wl=<domain.name>] ...

OPERATION:
        [-0]                            Safe minimum protection, set BLITZ=0
        [-1]                            Increased protection, set BLITZ=1
        [-2]                            Optimum protection, set BLITZ=2, [DEFAULT]
        [-3]                            Unlock maximum protection, set BLITZ=3
        [-d | -D]                       Ignore personal lists, set DISTRIB=1
        [-b | --bl=]    domain.name     Add domain.name to myblacklist
        [-w | --wl=]    domain.name     Add domain.name to mywhitelist
        [-p | --pause]                  Pause protection
        [-r | --resume]                 Resume protection
        [-r | --offline]                Process existing lists without downloading
        [-h | --help]                   Display this help screen and exit
        [-v | --version]                Print adbhostgen.sh version and exit

EXAMPLES:
        adbhostgen.sh -1 --bl=example1.com --wl=example2.com
        adbhostgen.sh -b example1.com -w example2.com --wl=example3.com


20180312rev1: 
BUGFIX

20180312:
A. New command line options to pause and resume protection.
B. Added more ad/malicious domains in both hosts and dnsmasq format.
C. BLITZ=0 is no longer an option.
   BLITZ=1 is the minimum protection level.
   BLITZ=2 mode now blocks approx 675000 unique ad/mal domains. [DEFAULT]
   BLITZ=3 is likely to result in ~40-50MB hosts file. Exercise caution.
